Some toy APIs to learn go!

## Getting Started

This project comes with a `docker-compose` setup! If you want to run the webserver use `docker-compose up dev`. The webserver will watch `*.go` files and recompile and restart whenever you make a change.

For testing, run `docker-compose up test`, again this process will watch for changes to `*.go` files and recompile and re-run the test suite on every change.
